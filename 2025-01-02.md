### Slovenia
- Would be much more outdoors-y oriented but also not beach-y cause Slovenia barely has any coast
- Ljubljana (the capital) is a fairly small town still, seems super pretty but not much to it as far as museums and that kinda stuff, just a pretty European town with nice food and shopping and pretty streets
- Lots of pretty lakes and that kinda thing to see, also castles

### Croatia
- Seems a lot cooler than Slovenia
- Still a lot of outdoors-y nature vibes but seems cooler from my minimal research, lots of really beautiful looking national parks
- Waaaay more coastline
- Seems like the coastal area is the coolest part of the country, called the Dalmatian Coast (where the dog originates from!)
- Split and Dubrovnik both seem really cool, seems like these are the 2 must-see cities
	- both on the coast and lots of really need history in both
	- Split has [Dioclesian's Palace](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/croatia/dalmatia/split/attractions/diocletian-s-palace/a/poi-sig/445175/358789) (name is misleading it isn't really just one building, it was a whole huge fortress and makes up about half of Split's old town today)
		- Looks like lots of other really cool history in Split!
	- Dubrovnik has these [city walls/forts](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/croatia/dubrovnik/attractions/city-walls-forts/a/poi-sig/1192927/358783) that go around the whole old town and you can walk along the whole thing. Looks really neat!
		- This is where King's Landing was filmed in Game of Thrones (the capital)
- Also tons of islands which could be cool
