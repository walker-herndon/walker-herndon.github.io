### Slovenia
- Would be much more outdoors-y oriented but also not beach-y cause Slovenia barely has any coast
- Ljubljana (the capitol) is a fairly small town still, seems super pretty but not much to it as far as museums and that kinda stuff, just a pretty European town with nice food and shopping and pretty streets
- Lots of pretty lakes and that kinda thing to see, also castles

### Croatia
- Seems a lot cooler than Slovenia
- Waaay more coastline
-
