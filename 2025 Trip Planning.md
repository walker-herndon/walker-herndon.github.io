### Slovenia
- Would be much more outdoors-y oriented but also not beach-y cause Slovenia barely has any coast
- Ljubljana (the capital) is a fairly small town still, seems super pretty but not much to it as far as museums and that kinda stuff, just a pretty European town with nice food and shopping and pretty streets
- Lots of pretty lakes and that kinda thing to see, also castles
- This isn't really jumping out at me immediately so moving to Croatia

### Croatia
- Seems a lot cooler than Slovenia
- Still a lot of outdoors-y nature vibes but seems cooler from my minimal research, lots of really beautiful looking national parks
- Waaaay more coastline
- Seems like the coastal area is the coolest part of the country, called the Dalmatian Coast (where the dog originates from!)
	- There is definitely some amount of cool stuff inlandâ€”that's where Zagreb is, but think we could totally fill a week with just the more coastal stuff and we'd all prefer that.
- Split and Dubrovnik both seem really cool, seems like these are the 2 must-see cities
	- both on the coast and lots of really need history in both
	- Split has [Dioclesian's Palace](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/croatia/dalmatia/split/attractions/diocletian-s-palace/a/poi-sig/445175/358789) (name is misleading it isn't really just one building, it was a whole huge fortress and makes up about half of Split's old town today)
		- Looks like lots of other really cool history in Split including a fortress and the ruins of an ancient city
	- Dubrovnik has these [city walls/forts](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/croatia/dubrovnik/attractions/city-walls-forts/a/poi-sig/1192927/358783) that go around the whole old town and you can walk along the whole thing. Looks really neat!
		- This is where King's Landing was filmed in Game of Thrones (the capital)
- Also tons of islands which could be cool
	- The [national park on Mljet island](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1501915-d548269-Reviews-Mljet_National_Park-Mljet_Island_Dubrovnik_Neretva_County_Dalmatia.html) looks beautiful, can do a boat trip through it
	- Hvar is a town on an island of the same name that [looks really pretty](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fa.cdn-hotels.com%2Fgdcs%2Fproduction64%2Fd1943%2F24e8c03a-2f2b-451f-a667-d65dd0be94b7.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=3f08a5c85af8fb5b78a102e367d7ef9df1065644857c011fe2e1a096b80d63dd&ipo=images)
- One downside of Croatia is it doesn't really seem to be like an ideal beach destination. There are pretty beaches in pretty areas but they're all pretty rocky, not really any good sand anywhere and any good sandy beaches that do exist are going to be busy.
