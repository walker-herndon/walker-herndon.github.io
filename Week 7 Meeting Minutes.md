**October 24**

Meeting Tuesday due to Kasim's schedule

- Not as much progress as I would've liked
	- Sick last week so not much done then
- This week been working on cleaning up code
- Set up GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/walker-herndon/arctic-charr-packaged) for record of work done
- Made [PR](https://github.com/walker-herndon/arctic-charr-packaged/pull/1) with lots of small fixes to code
- Made Python virtual environment to sort out dependencies and got all installed
- Now just need to actually run the code and see what that process looks like
- Also meeting Tuesday next week due to Kasim's schedule, should be back to normal after that?
