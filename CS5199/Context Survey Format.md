From ChatGPT:

**I. Introduction** 
A. Briefly introduce the topic of animal re-identification and its importance in ecological and biological research. 
B. State the specific focus of your dissertation: improving a tool for Arctic Charr re-identification in Iceland. 
C. Explain the objective of your literature review: to provide a comprehensive overview of relevant research, including the existing tool and the proposed improvements.

- Some of this will def go in the intro and not in the lit review, should the discussion of the existing tool be a part of the intro or lit review?

**II. Animal Re-identification Techniques** 
A. Provide an overview of traditional methods for animal re-identification (e.g., tagging, marking). 
B. Discuss the limitations and challenges associated with traditional techniques, especially in the context of Arctic Charr research. 
C. Introduce the concept of computer vision-based re-identification and its potential advantages.

- Some other source discussing past animal re-ID methods before computer vision? Is that in [4] already?

**III. Existing Animal Re-identification Tools** 
A. Review existing tools and software used for animal re-identification, with a focus on those applicable to fish or aquatic species. 
B. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these existing tools, highlighting any limitations or usability issues. 
C. Identify any tools that have been applied to Arctic Charr or similar species and their outcomes.

**IV. Previous Dissertation: Tool Development** 
A. Summarize the key findings and methodologies of the previous dissertation that led to the creation of the current tool. 
B. Discuss the success of the tool in re-identifying Arctic Charr and its contributions to the field. 
C. Highlight the technical nature of the tool (Python scripts) and its limitations for biologists with limited technical expertise.

**V. Packaging for Ease of Use** 
A. Discuss the importance of packaging the tool in a user-friendly manner for non-technical biologists. 
B. Explore literature on software packaging, GUI development, and user interface design for scientific tools. 
C. Describe strategies and best practices for making the tool accessible to a broader audience.

**VI. Siamese Comparison Network** 
A. Introduce the concept of Siamese networks and their potential advantages in animal re-identification tasks. 
B. Review existing literature on the application of Siamese networks in similar domains, such as facial recognition and object tracking. 
C. Explain how Siamese networks can be integrated into your tool to potentially improve re-identification accuracy.

**VII. Gaps in the Literature** 
A. Identify any gaps or shortcomings in the existing literature related to Arctic Charr re-identification and the tools available. 
B. Emphasize the need for your proposed improvements and the potential contributions to the field.

**VIII. Conclusion** 
A. Summarize the key points discussed in the literature review. 
B. Reiterate the importance of your dissertation in addressing the identified gaps and improving the tool for Arctic Charr re-identification. 
C. Provide a transition to the methodology and implementation sections of your dissertation, where you will detail how you plan to package the tool and integrate the Siamese comparison network.
