### Presentation
Go through whole presentation, discussing the background info on the project, problems with the tool and objectives, and results

### Demo
1. Show new README file to show the documentation
2. Show installation process by running the installation script
3. Don't wait for it to finish, just say it would take a couple minutes then show another terminal tab with it completed
4. Show how you would simply run `jupyter notebook` to then use the tool
5. Show Jupyter Notebook (already running to set everything up in advance)
6. Explain the new process for running the matcher
	1. Import the library
	2. Initialize the matcher
	3. Use DBUtil to create a list of images
	4. Run the matcher
	5. View matches

Can use existing notebook file for demo and just update and clean it up a bit.
