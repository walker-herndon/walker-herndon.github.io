**November 29th**
- not much to update this week, celebrated thanksgiving then was in London over the weekend so not a lot of time to do work
- was focused on building out the endpoints a bit more but should turn focus to making sure the matcher is giving good results before I keep going on that
- goal is to have everything in a good place by 2 weeks from now when I go home so I can focus on writing the report and not stress about the work while I'm home
