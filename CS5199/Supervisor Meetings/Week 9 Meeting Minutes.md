**November 8th**

- Working on transforming to library over past week
- Progress going well, all seems to be in a working state currently, but plan to create endpoints for the user so they don't have every function in the code exposed to them
- also have basic framework for writing tests in the future
- also been working on some documentation including how the image files need to be organized and named for the tool to correctly parse them
- after this need to look into a more complete packaging solution that doesn't require python or pip at all, but works totally standalone
	- means a python binary will need to be included in the package
- still waiting on full dataset to properly test code
	- **update:** Kasim found all the images including the annotated images and masks. Also has the trained models. Should get all of this by EOW.
- Goal is to get library implementation working by Monday's submission deadline and verify the code is all working.
