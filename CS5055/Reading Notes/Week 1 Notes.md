#### The Cartoon Introduction to Digital Ethics
[link](https://www.privacyconference2018.org/system/files/2018-10/Comic%20Book%20on%20Digital%20Ethics%20for%20Web.pdf)
- Basically just establishing the importance of digital ethics
- information is gold on the internet (aka data)
- lots of services exist with the primary purpose of collecting data
- this data isn't all bad, it allows for lots of amazing things to exist
- but it carries a lot of risks
	- for individuals
		- loss of privacy
		- discrimination
		- concentration of economic power
	- and for society
		- factionalism
		- extremism
		- more repressive government
- goal is to maximize good and minimize bad
- laws can help but aren't a complete solution
- digital ethics is the other side of this

- I'd argue there's still more to it than having good laws and good digital ethics, but think it's a good baseline

Rating: 4/5, good simple intro to the topic

#### Ethics Can't Be a Side Hustle
[link](https://deardesignstudent.com/ethics-cant-be-a-side-hustle-b9e78c090aee)
- Basically right of the bat claims working at Palantir is just inherently unethical (specifically because they helped work to identify illegal immigrants)
	- seems to have no awareness to the idea that Palantir pays any attention at all to ethics
- talks about how developers seem to debate whether or not they even need to concern themselves with ethics at all
	- this is probably true for some businesses, but the article kinda generalizes the idea to assume all tech companies are like this

*"A process flow put together by a designer at Palantir to round up immigrants."* (quote from article)

- This is obviously a very editorialized article, not great journalism
- Basic idea of the article though is to highlight that you need to be thinking about ethics at work more than anywhere else, which is very reasonable. Just fails to understand that Palantir is already very good at doing so.
- Basically says you should be willing to be fired over this if that's what it comes to which is a little much

Rating: 1/5, Short but not very well written. Has one simple point and fills the rest of the space dunking on companies with very little research or thought put into it.
#### The Evil List
[link](https://slate.com/technology/2020/01/evil-list-tech-companies-dangerous-amazon-facebook-google-palantir.html)
A lot of this list is pretty bullshit and there isn't really a lot of depth in the article. No real clear effort to back up the list besides pointing out one bad thing each company has done. Seems pretty arbitrary and poorly researched. Also very strange to put US tech companies like Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft higher on the list than big Chinese tech companies like Tencent, Bytedance, and Huawei.

SpaceX being on this list is super bizarre too, seems like the article is just being anti-Elon more than anything, but the reason the give for SpaceX is because their satellites had problems with being too reflective (which has now been fixed since this article was written), and apparently that point alone was enough to make them the 17th most evil company in the world????

Rating: 1/5, this list is a complete joke.
