#### What Things Regulate (Code 2.0)

- This is the book that discusses the four modalities of regulation/constraints
	1. Law
	2. Market
	3. Norms
	4. Architecture/Code
- Through these 4 modalities everything is constrained in some way
- Many examples given in the chapter
	- One good example was smoking, which has some constraints that come from each of the four modalities:
		1. Law: Smoking is regulated to some extent by the law. There are certain places where smoking is illegal (e.g. on a plane), and if you are under 18 you can't buy cigarettes.
		2. Market: Smoking is influenced, like all things, by the market. If cigarettes are more expensive people are less likely to buy them, or won't buy as many.
		3. Norms: Some places it is perfectly legal to smoke, but is frowned upon by society so people don't do it. If you are in a car with other people you'd never whip out a cigarette without at least asking first and rolling down a window.
		4. Architecture/Code: Smoking is influenced by the cigarettes themselves. For example, if a cigarette has a particularly bad odor you may be less inclined to smoke it, whereas if it doesn't smell at all and produces very little smoke, people might not mind at all. Vapes are kind of an example of this, people are less concerned with being around someone who is vaping than someone who is smoking.
- Talks about how people often see only government as being able to regulate things and constrain people, but all four of these modalities serve to do this just in different ways (government would be the law)
- Also points out that the government may regulate things without using the law directly, but instead through the use of one of the other modalities
	- In the example of getting people to wear seatbelts more, this could be done through any of the modalities:
		1. The government could just make it illegal to not wear a seatbelt (law)
		2. The government could do some sort of campaign to popularize the idea of wearing your seatbelt, therefore changing social norms (norms)
		3. The government could also subsidize insurance companies to offer reduced rates to people wearing seatbelts (market)
		4. Finally, the government could mandate systems in cars which help require people to wear seatbelts (architecture)
	- What is very important to note here is that all four of these options are really just law being used in different ways, the first one is very direct while the other three are using the law to influence another modality
	- This is an example of indirect regulation and it can be used to hide where the true source of the constraint is coming from
- Another example given of indirect regulation is when the government helped fund family planning centers but would only provide funding to centers which didn't give advice to patients recommending an abortion
	- In this way, doctors would point patients to other options and they would think the information is the opinion from a trusted doctor, when it really may just be the doctor saying what the government requires them to say
	- This allows the government to provide influence on the population without being put directly in the line of fire, people don't realize the true source of the influence
- Whether or not you agree with what the government did in this case, the important point is that indirect regulation can be used to hide the source of regulation
- It may also not always be in the form of law influencing another modality, although this is what the chapter focused on
- The big problem with the use of indirect regulation is that it causes a reduction in transparencyâ€”people don't realize the source of the constraints put on them and therefore aren't able to form informed opinions on them
Rating: 5/5, found this chapter super interesting and it provided many different really interesting examples of all of these modalities being used in many different ways in order to regulate people.
