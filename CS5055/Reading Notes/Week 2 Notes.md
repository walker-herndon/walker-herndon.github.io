#### Ethics and Contrastivism
[link](https://iep.utm.edu/ethics-and-contrastivism/)
- Talks a lot about Contrastivism
- Idea of comparing things to their alternatives instead of just accepting them at face value
	- Can be applied to a lot of things like knowledge
		- Instead of saying "x knows y", say "x knows y rather than z"
	- Can also be used for explanation
		- For example, instead of saying "the warm weather explains why it is raining", be more specific and contrast this to the alternative:
		- "The warm weather explains why it is raining instead of snowing" would be correct, but "the warm weather explains why it is raining instead of not precipitating" may not be
		- Using contrastivism seems to incentivize being more precise with your meaning
- Contrastivism can also be applied to ethics
	- Applied to obligation, contrastivism says that what you ought to do depends on the alternatives
	- It can also be applied to freedom and normative reasons
- Seems very philosophical overall and don't really see how these ideas should be applied in practice
Rating: 3/5, was fine but don't feel like it was saying anything super significant to me

#### An Introduction to Data Ethics
[link](https://www.scu.edu/media/ethics-center/technology-ethics/IntroToDataEthics.pdf)
- Gives an intro into what ethics means
- Obviously because technology is such an important part of our lives, ethics is important to consider in tech
- technology enables much more data collection and storage capabilities which makes data ethics important, especially because this data and what can be done with it can have significant impacts on peoples lives
- Discusses the potential harms and benefits data ethics presents
	- raises the point that the harms and benefits can be very significant but can be more difficult to see or anticipate because there is a level of abstraction present
- ethical implications of data are very wide reaching which makes the issue very complex and difficult to handle
- paper lists some specific key benefits of data practices
	- human understanding
	- social, institutional, and economic efficiency
	- predictive accuracy and personalization
- lists harms of data practices
	- harms to privacy and security
		- emphasis on lack of knowledge or informed consent
		- "much of this data does not stay confined to the digital context in which it was originally shared" e.g. sold to 3rd party organization which does who knows what with the data
		- Also not just about online activities, can relate to tracking through facial recognition in public for example
	- harms to fairness and justice
		- common causes of such harms are:
			- arbitrariness
			- avoidable errors and inaccuracies
			- unjust and often hidden biases
		- that article from The Sun about car insurance companies charging more to people named Muhammad is a good example of hidden biases
		- the problem is not the existence of biases, but whether or not they are just
		- usually these biases are implicitâ€”they are not deliberately put into place, but may have simply been absorbed from the training data for a model
	- harms to transparency and autonomy
		- it is important to have transparency in how you are impacted by data so that you may have autonomy in influencing this impact
		- if denied a loan by a bank, the bank should be transparent in informing you why the loan was denied so you can make changes in your life in order to be accepted for a loan in the future
		- often, current data practices reduce transparency due to:
			- the sheer volume and complexity of today's data
				- machine learning algorithms may make it very difficult to understand the reasoning for a decision it has made
			- the fact that data practices are often hidden behind proprietary software and trade secrets
				- vital to find a good balance between intellectual property rights and social transparency
- Case Study:
	- basically a couple gets rejected from a loan they should have been able to receive cause of an algorithm
