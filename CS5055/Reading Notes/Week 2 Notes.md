#### Ethics and Contrastivism
[link](https://iep.utm.edu/ethics-and-contrastivism/)
- Talks a lot about Contrastivism
- Idea of comparing things to their alternatives instead of just accepting them at face value
	- Can be applied to a lot of things like knowledge
		- Instead of saying "x knows y", say "x knows y rather than z"
	- Can also be used for explanation
		- For example, instead of saying "the warm weather explains why it is raining", be more specific and contrast this to the alternative:
		- "The warm weather explains why it is raining instead of snowing" would be correct, but "the warm weather explains why it is raining instead of not precipitating" may not be
		- Using contrastivism seems to incentivize being more precise with your meaning
- Contrastivism can also be applied to ethics
	- Applied to obligation, contrastivism says that what you ought to do depends on the alternatives
	- It can also be applied to freedom and normative reasons
- Seems very philosophical overall and don't really see how these ideas should be applied in practice
Rating: 3/5, was fine but don't feel like it was saying anything super significant to me
