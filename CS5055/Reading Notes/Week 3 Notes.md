### What does privacy mean?
To me, privacy means having the right to protecting and withholding "things" about oneself to the public or other people. "Things" is vague because it can fall under a lot of categories. This could be protecting information about yourself, or the protecting your property and restricting people from watching you in the *privacy* of your home. To me, the right to privacy is intertwined with the right to own private property (as the name suggests). If you are able to own something, you should be able to do with it what you want without the knowledge of others (within some amount of reason, which is where things get tricky).
### Reading Notes
#### The Right to Privacy
[link](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.st-andrews.ac.uk/stable/1321160?origin=crossref&seq=1)
- Foundational paper from 1890 discussing the right to privacy
- Starts by discussing how law has evolved over time and will continue to evolve
	- the "right to life" used to just protect people from battery, liberty meant freedom from physical restraint, the right to property only applied to land and cattle, etc
	- as society progressed, these laws became more generalized and began to apply to many more circumstances
	- this evolution was naturally as people's needs changed and evolved over time, as we gain more rights and become more civilized we find new areas where we wish to have formalized rights and the law conforms to this
	- this evolution was often of the form of changing a law or right which only applied to physical things and transforming into a right which applied to non-physical things, like thoughts, emotions, and sensations
	- common law is what allows for these rights to evolve over time as a society grows (common law is the use of legal precedent to in effect change law, obviously this is limited in its power though)
- In 1890 "technology" wasn't computers and AI, it was photographs and newspapers, but this still generated some of the same discussion regarding privacy
	- "Instantaneous photographs and newspaper enterprise have invaded the sacred precincts of private and domestic life"
	- At this point, there were discussions about if exchanging images of somebody without their permission violated their right to privacy, which is something that obviously did not end up being the case (at least according to the law)
	- this was about the time in history where news really became a significant thing as papers became cheap to produce, making information much more readily available and calling into question the potential for the press to be overstepping in the way in which they gather such information, and what they present without the consent of the people being presented
- this guy really doesn't like the press, talks a lot about how papers are perverse and bad
- I think this line really encapsulates what this paper is attempting to accomplish, or at least something that is super important (haven't read the rest of the paper so idk if this is really its aim):
	- **"It is our purpose to consider whether the existing law affords a principle which can properly be invoked to protect the privacy of an individual; and, if it does, what the nature and extent of such protection is."**
- There is a resemblance between injury inflicted by infringements on privacy and by slander and libel, but the legal foundation slander and libel are built from is radically different from privacy
	- the only overlap would be if public information about an individual causes him direct injury (not physical)
		- "the effect of the publication upon his estimate of himself and his own feelings not forming an essential element in the cause of action"
		- so if you feel like your privacy is violated but no one else cares you're out of luck
		- there must be some sort of material injury, even if not physical, when it comes to slander and libel
		- the law does not extend to harm of ones own feelings
- privacy does have some amount of foundation in common law coming from intellectual and artistic property, which can be seen as a form of privacy
- privacy also exists in the form of protecting people from sharing their own sentiments, no one can be forced to express their own thoughts (unless on the witness stand), and if thoughts are expressed people have the right to determine the extent in which they are shared (i.e. you have the right to determine the publishing of your own work, others cannot do so)
	- copyright laws focus on ensuring the artist is given the profits from their work, but common law is what actually ensures they have the right to determine the publishing of the work, thus, the common law right is lost as soon as the work has been published
