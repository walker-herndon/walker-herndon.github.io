### What does privacy mean?
To me, privacy means having the right to protecting and withholding "things" about oneself to the public or other people. "Things" is vague because it can fall under a lot of categories. This could be protecting information about yourself, or the protecting your property and restricting people from watching you in the *privacy* of your home. To me, the right to privacy is intertwined with the right to own private property (as the name suggests). If you are able to own something, you should be able to do with it what you want without the knowledge of others (within some amount of reason, which is where things get tricky).
### Reading Notes
#### The Right to Privacy

- Foundational paper from 1890 discussing the right to privacy
- Starts by discussing how law has evolved over time and will continue to evolve
	- the "right to life" used to just protect people from battery, liberty meant freedom from physical restraint, the right to property only applied to land and cattle, etc
	- as society progressed, these laws became more generalized and began to apply to many more circumstances
	- this evolution was naturally as people's needs changed and evolved over time, as we gain more rights and become more civilized we find new areas where we wish to have formalized rights and the law conforms to this
	- this evolution was often of the form of changing a law or right which only applied to physical things and transforming into a right which applied to non-physical things, like thoughts, emotions, and sensations
	- common law is what allows for these rights to evolve over time as a society grows (common law is the use of legal precedent to in effect change law, obviously this is limited in its power though)
- In 1890 "technology" wasn't computers and AI, it was photographs and newspapers, but this still generated some of the same discussion regarding privacy
	- "Instantaneous photographs and newspaper enterprise have invaded the sacred precincts of private and domestic life"
	- At this point, there were discussions about if exchanging images of somebody without their permission violated their right to privacy, which is something that obviously did not end up being the case (at least according to the law)
	- this was about the time in history where news really became a significant thing as papers became cheap to produce, making information much more readily available and calling into question the potential for the press to be overstepping in the way in which they gather such information, and what they present without the consent of the people being presented
