### What does privacy mean?
To me, privacy means having the right to protecting and withholding "things" about oneself to the public or other people. "Things" is vague because it can fall under a lot of categories. This could be protecting information about yourself, or the protecting your property and restricting people from watching you in the *privacy* of your home. To me, the right to privacy is intertwined with the right to own private property (as the name suggests). If you are able to own something, you should be able to do with it what you want without the knowledge of others (within some amount of reason, which is where things get tricky).
