### What does privacy mean?
To me, privacy means having the right to protecting and withholding "things" about oneself to the public or other people. "Things" is vague because it can fall under a lot of categories. This could be protecting information about yourself, or the protecting your property and restricting people from watching you in the *privacy* of your home. To me, the right to privacy is intertwined with the right to own private property (as the name suggests). If you are able to own something, you should be able to do with it what you want without the knowledge of others (within some amount of reason, which is where things get tricky).
### Reading Notes
#### The Right to Privacy
[link](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.st-andrews.ac.uk/stable/1321160?origin=crossref&seq=1)
- Foundational paper from 1890 discussing the right to privacy
- Starts by discussing how law has evolved over time and will continue to evolve
	- the "right to life" used to just protect people from battery, liberty meant freedom from physical restraint, the right to property only applied to land and cattle, etc
	- as society progressed, these laws became more generalized and began to apply to many more circumstances
	- this evolution was naturally as people's needs changed and evolved over time, as we gain more rights and become more civilized we find new areas where we wish to have formalized rights and the law conforms to this
	- this evolution was often of the form of changing a law or right which only applied to physical things and transforming into a right which applied to non-physical things, like thoughts, emotions, and sensations
	- common law is what allows for these rights to evolve over time as a society grows (common law is the use of legal precedent to in effect change law, obviously this is limited in its power though)
- In 1890 "technology" wasn't computers and AI, it was photographs and newspapers, but this still generated some of the same discussion regarding privacy
	- "Instantaneous photographs and newspaper enterprise have invaded the sacred precincts of private and domestic life"
	- At this point, there were discussions about if exchanging images of somebody without their permission violated their right to privacy, which is something that obviously did not end up being the case (at least according to the law)
	- this was about the time in history where news really became a significant thing as papers became cheap to produce, making information much more readily available and calling into question the potential for the press to be overstepping in the way in which they gather such information, and what they present without the consent of the people being presented
- this guy really doesn't like the press, talks a lot about how papers are perverse and bad
- I think this line really encapsulates what this paper is attempting to accomplish, or at least something that is super important (haven't read the rest of the paper so idk if this is really its aim):
	- **"It is our purpose to consider whether the existing law affords a principle which can properly be invoked to protect the privacy of an individual; and, if it does, what the nature and extent of such protection is."**
- There is a resemblance between injury inflicted by infringements on privacy and by slander and libel, but the legal foundation slander and libel are built from is radically different from privacy
	- the only overlap would be if public information about an individual causes him direct injury (not physical)
		- "the effect of the publication upon his estimate of himself and his own feelings not forming an essential element in the cause of action"
		- so if you feel like your privacy is violated but no one else cares you're out of luck
		- there must be some sort of material injury, even if not physical, when it comes to slander and libel
		- the law does not extend to harm of ones own feelings
- privacy does have some amount of foundation in common law coming from intellectual and artistic property, which can be seen as a form of privacy
- privacy also exists in the form of protecting people from sharing their own sentiments, no one can be forced to express their own thoughts (unless on the witness stand), and if thoughts are expressed people have the right to determine the extent in which they are shared (i.e. you have the right to determine the publishing of your own work, others cannot do so)
	- copyright laws focus on ensuring the artist is given the profits from their work, but common law is what actually ensures they have the right to determine the publishing of the work, thus, the common law right is lost as soon as the work has been published
- The paper talks a lot about previous cases regarding privacy and discusses many different angles of it. Interestingly, it uses a lot of British cases, so I guess all of the references to other cases aren't necessarily to supply legal precedent, but just to generally support the ideas being conveyed by the paper.
- It concludes by establishing 6 key points on privacy which are believed to exist:
	1. "The right to privacy does not prohibit any publication of matter which is of public or general interest."
		- Basically saying if you are a politician or something you are giving up some of your right to privacy as the public has the right to know more things about you than a regular citizen
	2. "The right to privacy does not prohibit the communication of any matter, though in its nature private, when the publication is made under circumstances which would render it a privileged communication according to the law of slander and libel."
		- Basically saying that publications that would normally violate the right to privacy, but which are made in a court, legislative body, or something similar, would not breech the right to privacy.
	3. "The law would probably not grant any redress for the invasion of privacy by oral publication in the absence of special damage."
		- Free speech really gets in the way of this, saying that if someone simply speaks publicly about a private matter you have no grounds to say your right to privacy was breeched, unless it is slander which is a whole separate issue. Only way you'd have any legs to stand on is if there was significant tangible damage caused, which would be difficult without it just being slander.
	4. "The right to privacy ceases upon the publication of the facts by the individual, or with his consent."
		- If you publish some private information about yourself, it is no longer considered private and would not be a violation of your right to privacy for someone else to speak further on the matter.
	5. "The truth of the matter published does not afford defense."
		- In this case, we would be getting into the matter of slander and libel, but in the case of just the right to privacy, the truth of the publication has no bearing on the case.
	6. "The absence of 'malice' in the publisher does not afford a defense."
		- The same can be said for whether the act was malicious, it doesn't matter what the actual intent was, just whether or not privacy was breeched.
- Remedies for an invasion of privacy are then given:
	1. "An action of tort for damages in all cases. Even in the absence of special damages, substantial compensation could be allowed for injury to feelings as in the action of slander and libel."
	2. "An injunction, in perhaps a very limited number of cases."

I think (in my extremely unprofessional opinion) generally this paper goes a bit to far in what it believes is covered in the right to privacy and doesn't do much to highlight the idea that whatever you do in public spaces kind of just immediately takes away any right to privacy you have. People can film or take pictures of you as much as they want and do what they want with them because you are in public and therefore allow that to happen.

Rating: 5/5, definitely understand why this is such a foundational paper on privacy
#### A Taxonomy of Privacy
[link](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40041279?origin=crossref)
##### Introduction
- The doozy—88 page paper...
- References a paper from 1960 which only really covers privacy in terms of "tort law", meaning in cases of there being direct harms to other people
- The idea of the paper is to level people's understanding of privacy. It calls it a "chameleon-like word" which can take many different meanings
- Privacy discussions appeal to our knee-jerk reaction to violations of it, if a company takes our data we instinctively hate it, but may struggle to articulate why the action was actually harmful to us
	- i.e. why should our right to privacy actually be protected? What are we wanting to gain from this?
	- On the other hand, the other side of the argument is easy to see—the company is clearly benefitting from it and is exercising their freedoms to perform these actions, making privacy difficult to fight for
- page 481 lists out a variety of scenarios which are all seen as violations of privacy but have very different circumstances and should be distinguished from one another
- The 1960 paper identified "four types of harmful activities redressed under the rubric of privacy":
	- "Intrusion upon the plaintiff's seclusion or solitude, or into his private affairs."
	- "Public disclosure of embarrassing facts about the plaintiff."
	- "Publicity which places the plaintiff in a false light in the public eye."
	- "Appropriation, for the defendant's advantage, of the plaintiff's name or likeness."
	- That 1960 paper was built off the 1890 "The Right to Privacy" paper
	- As mentioned before, that paper only focused on tort but there is a constitutional right to privacy beyond that which stems from the 4th amendment amongst other things
- This taxonomy is attempting to categorize these problematic activities related to privacy
	- for the most part, these activities are not inherently harmful, but become so if done without consent
	- an important point to recognize though is that people can be really bad about assessing risks and giving consent when they actually should be
		- for example, people will agree to give companies their data cause they just don't care and don't have a good understand of what the impact of that decision will be
- the article argues privacy should be seen as an umbrella term for a family of issues, they all relate to one another but do not have one single common trait between them
- because of the variety, the paper argues that if we can identify the different issues which exist within the family, we can be more precise with our language instead of just using the blanket term of "privacy" which can conflate different kinds of problems and cause confusion
- some privacy problems don't cause any direct harm to an individual, and are referred to as "architectural" problems in the paper
	- these problems cause more of a creation of risk that a person may be harmed in the future rather than causing harm directly
	- can be seen as similar to environmental harms or pollution
	- there are two different types of architectural problems:
		- those that create a greater risk that the individual is harmed in the future, for example if a company takes your data it may may lead to identity fraud using that data in the future after a data leak
		- those that generally upset the balance of social or institutional power, the example of surveillance is given, which can create a "chilling effect" where people become more afraid of certain activities because they are aware that they may face repercussions by the government who will be able to see what they are doing (e.g. speaking out against the government)
- This paper overall lists 4 different groups of harmful activities:
	- information collection
	- information processing
	- information dissemination
	- invasion

##### Information Collection
###### Surveillance
- The idea of a "Peeping Tom" dates all the way back to 1050 and many states have "Peeping Tom" laws today which dictate that people can't be spied on in their homes through windows or anything like that
- Some states also prohibit two-way mirrors in certain areas (presumably public restrooms or locker rooms for example)
- Wiretapping is another big issue in surveillance which was outlawed in many states and eventually made a federal crime
	- these protections were extended further in 1968 and amended in 1986 to include other forms of electronic surveillance
	- the protections ensure that wiretapping cannot be done without a warrant, meaning private parties cannot wiretap at all
- What are the harms of surveillance?
