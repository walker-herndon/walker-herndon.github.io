- Meta-ethics
	- Why act morally?
		- egoism
		- altruism
		- rationalism
		- feminism
	- morality == ethics?
- Normative ethics
	- What are moral standards?
	- One ultimate criterion of moral conduct
		- e.g. the Golden Rule or sunlight test
	- Virtues or duties/obligations (deontology)
		- not doing things because you believe in them but because you are obligated to
		- vs. consequentialism
- Computers have evolved over time and data ethics has to be reframed as this evolution occurs
	- In the 60s computers were huge and no one had their own, they'd be at universities and that sort of thing
	- In the 80s people started getting PCs as computers became more affordable and portable
	- In the 2000s the rise of the "information superhighway" (i.e. the internet) brought forth information ethics as significantly more information became available to people
	- In the 2020s technology and data are used everywhere, for good and bad
		- everywhere means they are pervasive and large-scale
			- who has access to this data and are they making good ethical choices with it? Probably not
- Surveillance during covid is a good case study for data ethics
	- made a big list of what we did, what the goods were, and what the harms were
- more generally we can lay out a few benefits and harms of data collection
	- benefits:
		- human understanding
		- social, institutional, and economic efficiency
		- predictive accuracy and personalization
	- harms:
		- harms to privacy & security
		- harms to fairness & justice
		- harms to transparency & autonomy
- can think about data in three axes (took notes on this in [[Week 2 Notes]])
	- ethics of data
	- ethics of algorithms
	- ethics of practices
