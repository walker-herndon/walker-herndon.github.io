- Computers have evolved over time and data ethics has to be reframed as this evolution occurs
	- In the 60s computers were huge and no one had their own, they'd be at universities and that sort of thing
	- In the 80s people started getting PCs as computers became more affordable and portable
	- In the 2000s the rise of the "information superhighway" (i.e. the internet) brought forth information ethics as significantly more information became available to people
	- In the 2020s technology and data are used everywhere, for good and bad
		- everywhere means they are pervasive and large-scale
			- who has access to this data and are they making good ethical choices with it? Probably not
- Surveillance during covid is a good case study for data ethics
