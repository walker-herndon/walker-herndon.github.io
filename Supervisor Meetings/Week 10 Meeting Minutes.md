**November 15th**

- Finally have all the data now, images are on GPU PC at `/data/kt54/Photographs`, and annotations and all models and code have been downloaded to Macbook, can use FileZilla to transfer over what I need.
- Figured out all SSH issues, can now use FileZilla on GPU PC and can access from outside the university network. All info on how to do anything is contained in [[GPU PC Info]].
- Also figured out how to use Jupyter notebook from the GPU PC, also included in the above documentation.
- Trying to get the library working now and fairly close to having something proper to demo
- Goal is to have that figured out in the next couple of days and have a full workflow to show, then write up clear documentation for that process.
- Early next week I should be able to start exploring a more comprehensive packaging approach and also have something to talk about regarding that for next meeting.
- Next meeting at regular timeâ€”November 22nd at 1:00
