**November 22nd**

- Got jupyter notebook working
- not toooo bad of a process, but also not amazingly straightforward
- code had a couple bugs I had to fix with numpy not liking inhomogeneous arrays that I needed to fix
- wrote some clear documentation for usage to clear up what directories need to be passed in, where things get saved, and how exactly the matcher works so you know what to expect from it

- began looking into python freezing, seems to be a pretty straightforward process, no more difficult than what I did to make the code into a library
- only difference is to use the code in that form there will need to be some form of UI since the user isn't writing any python at that point
	- maybe this means I should look into the UI that was previously created now?
- also still not handling the model training side of things at all so may want to look into that too
