**October 31**
- Not a lot done last week
	- Code seems to work from what I can test, but don't have all the image data needed
	- Can't test training the model and seeing if the matching *actually* works, but at least runs
- Should get images at some point this week
	- **Update:** Michael looking into getting photos today, will definitely be in the next few days at worst
- In the meantime, can start looking into packaging this into a library for use in Jupyter notebooks
