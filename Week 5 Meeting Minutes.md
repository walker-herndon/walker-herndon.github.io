**October 11**

- Update on context survey
	- About half done with writing
	- Ideally finish writing tomorrow (Thursday) and have Friday to revise and clean up everything
- How to split content between intro and context survey?
	- Give just enough info the in introduction to get across what I'm trying to accomplish
	- Fill in the rest of the detail in the context survey
	- Nothing is set in stone right now, can always move stuff around if need be later
- Meet during reading week and try to get code working before next meeting so we can discuss what the current state of everything is
