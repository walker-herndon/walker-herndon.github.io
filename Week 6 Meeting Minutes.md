Reading Week Meeting

- Got context survey done
	- Pretty much in a good place, but maybe some slight tweaking - not perfect yet
- Tool not quite up and running yet
- UI is web based? What does that mean for how we want to approach it
	- Focus on the tool itself first and getting that in a nice place first
	- Deal with GUI second and decide if it is worthwhile to include or not
	- Could make the whole thing a web application and host it somewhere, but that will come with its own set of issues to handle. Although the user experience would be very nice.
	- Best approach probably to package the tool first as a local application, then maybe try to get the UI working locally? Worth trying at least.
- Trying the Siamese network with the fish mask could lead to good results
