**September 27**

Minutes were written after the fact to have a record of what we covered. More of a summary of what was discussed, but not really a lot of specific info.

- Review DOER draft
	- Focus objectives less on outcome/impact and more on specific tasks to accomplish
- Ethics looks good, ready to submit
- Next step is context survey, basically lit review with ~30 sources
	- Can use UI diss to get an idea of how to structure it
	- Also get some sources from UI diss
- With context survey submission should also create framework of the structure for the final diss submission and submit that together
	- Makes it easy as I go to see where gaps need to be filled in and work on it over time
- Also start working on getting GPU PC working and try to get code running on it
